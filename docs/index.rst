Welcome to the HySOM documentation
===========================================================

This is the documentation for the **HySOM** Python package. **HySOM** provides tools for analyzing concentration - discharge hysteresis 
loops sing Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). The source code is available on `Github <https://github.com/ArlexMR/C-Q-Hysteresis-analysis-tools->`_

On this documentation page, you’ll find a quickstart guide with instructions on installation and usage of the package, including sample data. We’ve also written a few 
tutorials that walk you through code examples to train and use SOM for C-Q hysteresis analysis.
